Some CODA V10.002 products were too large for a single CD and were sub-divided on a platform basis as follows:

  -  "split 1" items contain software for installation on the Windows client
  -  "split 2" items contain software for installation on HP-UX (PA-RISC), Sun Solaris, Tru64 UNIX
  -  "split 3" items contain software for installation on IBM AIX, IBM OS/400

Where a CODA product could fit on a single CD it was not split, and all platforms are available together.
