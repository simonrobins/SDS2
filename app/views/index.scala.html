<p>Finding your way around the Software Distribution Server (SDS) should be straightforward, but below is a brief overview to assist.</p>
<p>There are 4 key areas:</p>
<p><b>Releases:</b>  Here, you will find all product major Base Releases, and any Maintenance Releases. Notations should be self-explanatory, but if in any doubt please contact GSD.</p>
<p><b>Service Packs:</b>  Here you will find the latest Service Packs for all products that support this release mechanism.</p>
<p><b>Language Packs:</b> Here you will find the latest language packs for all supported versions of our products that require them.</p>
<p><b>Support Area:</b> Here you will find any ad-hoc software releases such as hot-fixes, Special Ad-Hoc Requests (SAR), one-off releases etc.</p> 
<p>Depending on the nature of the software you choose to download, various formats may be available to you. These are described below:</p>
<p><b>.ISO</b> - An ISO image (or .ISO file) is a computer file that is an exact copy of an existing file system.  An ISO can contain the entire contents of a CD-ROM disc or CD medium. ISO files are typically created through a software application that will open, create, edit, and extract CD or DVD image files, then convert the extracted image to an ISO file, easily allowing users to burn an exact copy of the original onto CD or DVD.</p>
<p><b>.zip</b> - ZIP is a file format where the files are compressed (referred to as &quot;zipped&quot;). Using a file compression program (such as PKZip for DOS, or Winzip for Windows), a zip file could be created from one or more original files. When downloading a zipped file (with the extension .zip), you can unzip it using a program.</p>
<p><b>.jar</b> - JAR (Java ARchive) is an archive file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images and so on) into one file to distribute application software or libraries on the Java platform. Your IT department will understand this notation.</p>
<p>Please remember to choose carefully what you download, as the larger the file you request the more time it will take. If you don&#39;t need it now, don&#39;t download it - it will always be there for you another time.</p>
<p>The SDS is designed to give access only to software you are entitled to have, but if you can&#39;t find what you&#39;re after then please contact GSD to help you out - it may be as simple as a data entry error blocking access.</p>
